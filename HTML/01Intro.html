          A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), colloquially termed a web
          address,[1] is a reference to a web resource that specifies its
          location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A
          URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI),[2][3]
          although many people use the two terms interchangeably.[4][a] URLs
          occur most commonly to reference web pages (HTTP/HTTPS) but are also
          used for file transfer (FTP), email (mailto), database access (JDBC),
          and many other applications.

          an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between
          networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network
          protocol stack.
